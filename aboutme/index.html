        <h2>Adam Sheridan</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Adam Sheridan. I am a student here at BYUI, and I am enjoying my third semester here. I am currently majoring in software engineering. So far I really like my classes. I am taking this Web Fundamentals class to learn how to make websites and use the languages assosiated with it such as HTML.</p>
        <p>I was born a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My favorite speaker to listen to in general conference is Jeffery R Holland. I think that he is a very powerful speaker.</p>
        <p>I am from Georgia and have lived there for my whole life, so it's home to me. I like to play soccer, run, and swim in my free time. I also prefer the heat to the cold, so you won't find me in Idaho during the winter time.</p>
