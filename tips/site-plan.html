        Procrastination can look like a variety of things. It can be as simple as taking a quick nap or as extravagant as going on a vacation or
         to a party. There is not anything inherently wrong with these activities on their own, but when it comes to meeting deadlines it’s
          important that they do not stop you from getting tasks done. In many cases these activities add to your ability to function at your
           best level, and therefore, it can be used to finish assignments in a short amount of time. This section of the United Procrastinators
            Association website will give you helpful tips on how you can make procrastination work in your favor.
