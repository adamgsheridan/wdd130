            <h1>Procrastination Tips</h1>
            <p>Procrastination can look like a variety of things. It can be as simple as taking a quick nap or as
                extravagant as going on a
                vacation or to a party. There is not anything inherently wrong with these activities on their own, but
                when it comes to
                meeting deadlines itâ€™s important that they do not stop you from getting tasks done. In many cases these
                activities add to
                your ability to function at your best level, and therefore, it can be used to finish assignments in a
                short amount of
                time. This section of the United Procrastinators Association website will give you helpful tips on how
                you can make
                procrastination work in your favor.

                <li>Hanging out with Friends- Wholesome times with friends can eliminate stress and help you stay emotionally
                happy. It's hard to
                focus when you are stressed or unhappy. Friends can change that.
                </li>
                <li>Take a Nap- When you aren't rested you're less likely to be productive. It can be hard to work when you
                need to recharge.
                Taking a quick nap can give you the chance to clear your mind and get some energy.</li>
